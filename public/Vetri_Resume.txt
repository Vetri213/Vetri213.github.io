EXPERIENCE
Bornea Dynamics LimitedJan 2025 – Apr 2025
Robotics/AI Engineering InternSt. Catherines, Ontario
•
Conducted computer vision R&D for theUK Ministry of Defence's missile targeting programand achieved92%
post-quantization accuracyby tuning YOLO-based models and ONNX quantization settings for ASIC deployment.
•
Led a defence-oriented R&D initiative to assess AI-based personality classification using LLaMA models; built a
dual-model system combining a real-time chatbot and a fine-tuned classifier trained on scraped behavioural data,
and delivered a technical proposal to the CEO evaluating its feasibility for future defence-sector applications.
Canadian Space Agency (CSA)Sep 2024 – Dec 2024
Software Engineering InternLongueuil, Quebec
•
Built a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps, Docker, and Playwright to automate testing for web systems supporting
theInternational Space Station, reducing verification time from 16–24 months to under 24 hours and enabling
safer updates to Canadarm2 and DEXTRE data workflows.
•
Developed and maintained comprehensive Playwright test suites and collaborated with external contractors to
expand automated coverage across legacy and high-reliability systems supporting space mission data.
TD Bank GroupMay 2024 – Aug 2024
Software Engineer Intern/Co-opToronto, Ontario
•
Developed and deployed a full-stack Unified Referral System across three integrated React.js and Java-based web
applications, streamlining client-to-specialist routing at branches and improving referral efficiency by 60%; ensured
reliable delivery using Git, Bitbucket, and JIRA within an agile team.
•
Created two AI tools using Node.js, Azure, and OpenAI APIs to assist with anti-money laundering detection and
customer service efficiency, earning executive interest for potential enterprise-wide implementation.
McMaster University Telerobotics, Haptics and Computational Vision LaboratorySep 2023 – Dec 2023
Robotics Research StudentHamilton, Ontario
•
Achieved low-latency multi-sensor synchronization between depth camera and LiDAR using ROS and C++, enabling
reliable real-time obstacle detection for a self-driving robot through system-level debugging and integration.
PROJECTS, PUBLICATIONS, AND AWARDS
Mind-Link: Brain Computer Interface|Muse EEG, Real-Time Signal Processing, Python, React NativeApr 2025
•
Built a brain-computer interface using Muse EEG sensors to classify patterns associated with cognitive states in
non-verbal stroke patients, achieving 83% cross-validated accuracy by extracting Alpha/Beta band features and
training an SVM to detect signals corresponding to hunger, pain, calm, and alertness.
•
Integrated the system with a React Native mobile app using Python, Lab Streaming Layer, and WebSockets to
deliver real-time alerts and visual feedback based on live EEG classification.
Gesture-Controlled Omni-directional Car|Computer Vision, Embedded Systems, Motor ControlFeb 2025
•
Developed a real-time gesture-controlled omni-directional car by integrating motor drivers, PWM control, and
embedded firmware on Arduino to simulate ECU-style logic for direction and movement control.
